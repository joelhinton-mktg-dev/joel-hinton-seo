                - generic:
                  - paragraph: "After 15+ years in digital marketing, I've learned that most agencies focus on the wrong things. They obsess over keywords, ad placements, and technical tricks while completely ignoring the most important factor: how people actually make decisions."
                  - paragraph: Traditional marketing treats customers like search engines—feed them the right keywords and they'll convert. But real growth comes from understanding the psychology behind every click, every search, and every purchase decision.
                  - paragraph: That's why I built my entire approach around consumer decision science, rooted in lessons from Edward Bernays' work and modern behavioral psychology. When you understand what motivates people at a psychological level, marketing becomes predictable rather than hopeful.

                  - paragraph: I started like most marketers—chasing the latest tactics, celebrating vanity metrics, and wondering why campaigns that looked great on paper failed to move business needles. After managing millions in ad spend and countless SEO campaigns, I realized something was fundamentally wrong with how our industry approaches growth.

                - paragraph: When agencies charge percentages of ad spend, they profit when you spend more, not when you spend efficiently. When they require monthly retainers, they benefit from dependency, not from building systems that work independently.
